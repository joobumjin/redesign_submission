        <h1>Responsive Redesign: Submission</h1>

        <h1>1. Identifying Usability Problems</h1> 
        <h2>Picking a Webpage</h2> 
        <p>I decided to work on When2Meet, a scheduling and availability surveying platform that is commonly used (at least by my peers!)</p>
        <p>Here's what it looks like when you click on the link (after signing in!)</p>

        <img src="./assets/when2meet_desktop.png" alt="When2Meet on Desktop">
        <p>And what it might look like on mobile!</p>

        <img src="./assets/when2meet_narrow.png" alt="When2Meet on Desktop">

        <p>I chose this website primarily because it provides a really useful tool: 
            availability comparison at a glance, but has many interactive elements 
            that are unintuitive or difficult to remember, even despite my frequent usage.</p>

        <h2>Finding Problems</h2>

        <h3>Learnability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Interacting with the personal availability table is unintuitive at first, with no real indicators on how it should be used!</li>
            <li>There's also nothing indicating that you can see who is available at each time slot</li>
            <li>Controls only become more confusing on mobile </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Memorability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Big, simple elements spaced out properly make the essential interactions easy to recall</li>
            <li>Mobile controls don't really line up with expectations and always give me pause on first glance</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Filling out the availability table on the left is pretty simple and quick once the controls are known</li>
            <li>The visual cues on the Group Availability table + seeing individual availability on hover makes finding an ideally compatible time pretty simple as well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, too many responses means that certain names are cut off when seeing individual availability, because you might not be able to scroll down while still hovering that time block</li>
            <li>Typical tasks on mobile devices are very difficult, as certain tables can go off screen</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>

        <p>
            The primary WAVE Report errors come from missing attributes on things like language, input fields (text boxes), etc. These are definitely important things that aren't physically visible, but contribute to a more accessible and navigable interface. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The results also note that the hover-to-show interaction to show individual availability from Group Availability is device dependent and might not be accessible with just a keyboard. I think this is a very prescient observation that might indicate that an entire feature is inaccessible to certain users. 
        </p>

        <h1>Visual Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Speed Sketches</h2>
        <p>Here's 9 different speed sketch concepts for potential changes and redesigns.</p>
        <img src="./assets/speed_sketch.JPG" alt="Speed Sketch Concepts">
        <p>The changes primarily focus on making elements look more clickable and more easily accessible</p>

        <h2>Final Sketch</h2>
        <p>Here's the final sketch used to inspire the layout of my redesign</p>
        <img src="./assets/final_sketch.JPG" alt="Final Sketch Concept">
        <p>The desktop layout remains largely similar, but with inclusions of effects that make cells look more clickable</p>
        <p>However, the mobile experience was redesigned to have a single availability matrix per screen so that the matrices appear bigger and are easier to interact with on mobile.</p>

        <h2>LoFi Wireframes</h2>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>Here's my style guide!</p>
        <img src="./assets/Style Guide.png" alt="Style Guide">

        <p>However, the original website is really minimal</p>

        <p>I thought it was really important to maintain the minimal aesthetics, because it
            really highlights the interactive elements and makes understanding the experience much simpler.
        </p>

        <p>
            To some degree, I thoght that the utilitarian minimalism used by the website actually distinguished the page from other
            sites and made it more memorable.
        </p>

        <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <p>My Responsive Redesign can be found <a href="https://joobumjin.github.io/resposive_redesign/">at this link</a>, while the code for it can be <a href="https://github.com/joobumjin/resposive_redesign">found here</a></p>

        <h2>Desktop</h2>
        <p>Here's a screenshot of the redesigned page</p>
        <img src="./assets/redesign.png" alt="Screenshot of redesigned page">
        <p>And scrolling down</p>
        <img src="./assets/redesign_2.png" alt="Screenshot of redesigned page, scrolled down">

        <p>As was the case with the sketches, the layout for the desktop remains largely unchanged. Moreover,
            given that this project was implemented solely through HTML + CSS, functional buttons and dynamic pages weren't really possible.
        </p>

        <p>However, one thing I did want to note was the more intuitive "clickability" of matrix elements. 
            As demonstrated in the video below, I made "your availability" calendar slots clickable. I also condensed
            blocks of time in group availability where a consistent number of people are available, and made those
            condensed blocks clickable (ideally to bring up the availability lists).
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, for the group availability matrix, each of the condensed time slots has text which
            describes the time range of availability. On top of that, these time slots also have aria labels which
            hopefully increase the accessibility of the site (as noted by the WAVE Report!)
        </p>

        </video>

        <h2>Mobile</h2>
        <p>Likewise, here's some screenshots for what the page might look like on mobile devices:</p>
        <img src="./assets/mobile_redesign.png" alt="Screenshot of redesigned page with narrow aspect ratio">
        <img src="./assets/mobile_redesign_2.png" alt="Screenshot of redesigned page with narrow aspect ratio">
        <img src="./assets/mobile_redesign_3.png" alt="Screenshot of redesigned page with narrow aspect ratio">
        <p>One of the biggest changes in the mobile layout was to change the layout to be a single long column.
            Consequently, each interface element is much bigger and easier to interact with.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, because it might be difficult to click on small availability blocks in the group matrix,
            I also included a Best Times section which (ideally) summarizes all the best slots without needing any extra clicks.
        </p>

        <p>I did not actually work on implementing the toggle for this project (as illustrated in my wireframes).
            Though it would have made for an efficient, condensed interface, I simply ran out of time and 
            thought that there would have been a really steep time investment to implement such an interface
            through pure HTML + CSS.
        </p>

        <h1>Reflections</h1>

        <p>All in all, this was a really interesting process to go through and I think my redesign turned out quite well!</p>

        <p>And though I redesigned the site in a way that I would like to use myself, 
            I would be really interested in pursuing user interviews and creating personas to build a better
            product not just for myself but for a broad range of people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, I also don't tend to work on projects fully alone, unlike this experience.
            I am left pretty curious about how my peers might have chosen to redesign certain aspects about the interface, and whether they would have 
            leaned heavier into overhauling more and more elements to have a better differentiated experience.
